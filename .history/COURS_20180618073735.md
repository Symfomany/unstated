### Motivation

https://redux.js.org/introduction/motivation

### 3 Principes

- Single source of truth
  The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store.

- State is read-only
  The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.

- Changes are made with pure functions
  To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

## Essentially, the redux store does the following:

- Holds application state
- Allows access to state via getState(). The getState method returns the current state tree of your app.
- Allows state to be updated via dispatch(action) . The dispatch method “dispatches” an action, consequently triggering a state change.
- Registers listeners via subscribe(listener) . The subscribe(listener) adds a change listener. Similar to Flux’s change listener methods.
- Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by subscribe(listener).

Pourquoi ds constantes:

- Why is this beneficial? It is often claimed that constants are unnecessary, and for small projects, this might be correct. For larger projects, there are some benefits to defining action types as constants:

- It helps keep the naming consistent because all action types are gathered in a single place.

- Sometimes you want to see all existing actions before working on a new feature. It may be that the action you need was already added by somebody on the team, but you didn’t know.
  The list of action types that were added, removed, and changed in a Pull Request helps everyone on the team keep track of scope and implementation of new features.
  If you make a typo when importing an action constant, you will get undefined. This is much easier to notice than a typo when you wonder why nothing happens when the action is dispatched.

Redux architecture revolves around a strict unidirectional data flow.
